### Hi there 👋

My name is Ivan Spetter, a Front-End developer.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔊 I love speaking in public!
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Front-End Developer.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to write higher quality, scalable, and maintainable software.
- 🐒 Fun fact: I'm on a mission to get lemurs the emoji they deserve!.
